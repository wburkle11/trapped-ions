## EIT Cooling

The performance of quantum operations with atoms and ions can be improved by ground state cooling of the atoms (or ions) vibrational degrees of freedom. Moreover, quantum simulations with both vibrational and fermionic degrees
of freedom naturally demand ground state cooling of vibrational modes. As the size of quantum systems scaling up, it is all the more neccesarry to ensure that we have an effecient way of ground state cooling large numbers
of modes. 

EIT cooling provides an alternative to Resolved Sideband Cooling. It is capable of cooling a very wide range of vibrational modes simultaneously. EIT cooling utilizes quantum interference is a three level Λ-scheme. This 
is typically refered to as "Single" EIT cooling in the literature. For 171Yb+, the excited state |e⟩ = |F = 0, m=0⟩ in the P₁/₂ manifold is coupled to three states, |-⟩ = |F = 1, m=-1⟩, |+⟩ = |F = 1, m=1⟩, and |0⟩ = |F = 1, m=0⟩
in the S₁/₂ manifold. This four level system altogether form two Λ-scheme's, each producing Fano-like profiles in the atomic absorbtion spectrum.
