## EIT Cooling 

**MAIN SCRIPT - EIT_Functions.py**

The performance of quantum operations with trapped ions can be improved by ground state cooling of the atoms vibrational degrees of freedom. Moreover, quantum simulations with both vibrational and fermionic degrees
of freedom naturally demand ground state cooling of vibrational modes. With the size of quantum systems scaling up, it is all the more neccesarry to develop an effecient ground state cooling technique for larger numbers of ions and each of the corresponding modes. These modes are associated with the ions oscillations along one particular trap axis. 

EIT cooling provides an alternative to Resolved Sideband Cooling. It is capable of cooling a very wide range of vibrational modes simultaneously. EIT cooling utilizes quantum interference is a three level Λ-scheme. This 
is typically refered to as "Single" EIT cooling in the literature. For 171Yb+, the excited state |e⟩ = |F = 0, m=0⟩ in the P₁/₂ manifold is coupled to three states, |-⟩ = |F = 1, m=-1⟩, |+⟩ = |F = 1, m=1⟩, and |0⟩ = |F = 1, m=0⟩
in the S₁/₂ manifold. This four level system altogether form two Λ-scheme's, each producing Fano-like profiles in the atomic absorbtion spectrum.
